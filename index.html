                My name is Esther Bae, and I am a senior with a major in Information Systems and a minor in Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. I am Korean-American, and I was born and raised in Northern Virginia.

                In my free time, I like to crochet and learn dances, among many other sports and activities. I started to crochet during COVID-19 quarantine, and I have been dancing since I was in high school.
                For this 67-240 assignment, I chose to focus on my hobbies, specifically crochet and dance projects from the past couple of years. The theme will include past projects and dances I've learned, with pictures and videos.
